# Adding a new workflow to kdevops

A demo workflow has been introduced to kdevops to serve the purpose of
a simple demo but also to help with documentation. The best documentation
is for now to tell refer you to the upstream commit for the workflow
addition.

This workflow has tons of documentation spread out for it. It is also
recommended after reading this commit to read the files now, as this
process has been made easier over time.
