	  Bring up typically just consists of having the systems accessible
	  via ssh. However, most of these systems are pretty bare bones and
	  useless right after bring up, likely with stale repositories or
	  software. Enabling this option will only try to update the
	  repositories. If you require registration to update your repositories
	  that implies we will try to register your system if you enable that.
	  You will need to enable this option to install any packages through
	  the automated system on kdevops.

	  Disabling this is a good idea if all you want to do is test raw
	  bring up of kdevops.
