# mcgrof: I make comments on expunges which I disagree with because either
# most kernels should have fixes for them or I am not seeing these issues
# myself.

# generic/042 and generic/392 are failing because ext4 forces the
# resolution of all delayed allocation writes before allowing the
# punch operation to proceed.  We probably want to see if we can avoid
# this for the future, but what ext4 is doing is legal, so just skip
# the test for now
## mcgrof: I am not seeing these fail though, so ignore these 2 expunges
## generic/042
## generic/392

# generic/04[456] tests how truncate and delayed allocation works
# ext4 uses the data=ordered to avoid exposing stale data, and
# so it uses a different mechanism than xfs.  So these tests will fail
generic/044
generic/045
generic/046

# generic/223 tests file alignment, which works on ext4 only by
# accident because we're not RAID stripe aware yet, and works at all
# because we have bias towards aligning on power-of-two block numbers.
# It is a flaky test for some configurations, so skip it.
## mcgrof: not sure why I am not seeing this fail...
## generic/223

# The shutdown ioctl will sometimes result in a corrupted file systems
# it really shouldn't, but we probably won't have it fixed for a while.
# So exclude it for now.
## mcgrof: I guess this is fixed upstream
## generic/388
