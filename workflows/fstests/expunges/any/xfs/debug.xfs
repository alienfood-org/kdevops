# Requires upstream commit 2e2271787419a ("xfs: export log_recovery_delay to
# delay mount time log recovery") to enable testing log recovery with
# device mapper dm-flakey. This commit adds:
#
# /sys/fs/xfs/debug/log_recovery_delay
#
# This was merged as of v3.18, but you also need a CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG kernel.
