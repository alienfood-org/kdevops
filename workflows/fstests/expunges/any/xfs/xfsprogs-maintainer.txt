# These are tests for the maintainer of xfsprogs to run only. We don't
# need to be running them. They are just informational.

# libxfs-diff needs KWORKAREA and WORKAREA set. If you really wanted
# to set these you can use something like:
# export WORKAREA="/usr/src/packages/BUILD/xfsprogs-4.13.1/"
# export KWORKAREA="/usr/src/linux-4.12.14-6.1/"
