# Based on a quick glance on the errors, one possibility is that
# perhaps generic tests do not have the semantics necessary to
# determine if an external log is used in a generic form and adjust
# the test for this. But that does not seem to be the case for all
# tests. A common error for at least two tests seems to be size
# related, and that may be a limitation on the log size, and the
# inability to generically detect the filesyste log size max allowed
# to then invalidate the test. But note that we even have XFS specific
# tests which fail, so if its a matter of semantics this is all just
# crap and are missing a lot of work for improvement.
